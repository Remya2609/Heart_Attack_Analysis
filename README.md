# Heart_Attack_Analysis
A heart attack, medically known as a myocardial infarction, occurs when blood flow to the heart is severely reduced or blocked, typically due to a buildup of fat, cholesterol, and other substances forming a plaque in the coronary arteries. This blockage can lead to the formation of a blood clot, which disrupts the oxygen supply to the heart muscle, potentially causing damage or death to the affected heart tissue.
This analysis leverages data-driven approaches to identify patterns and correlations that contribute to heart attack risks. By applying machine learning algorithms, healthcare providers can estimate the probability of a heart attack for a specific individual and provide personalized recommendations for preventive measures.
The goal is to enable early detection and proactive management of heart disease, ultimately reducing the prevalence of heart attacks and improving patient outcomes. This problem is crucial for advancing preventive cardiology and empowering individuals to take control of their cardiovascular health.
